# BookStore

## A little 3 tier application

- Backend: Rest API (with help from [Brad Traversy](https://traversymedia.com). His videos have helped me a lot. Follow him on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia) if you can.)
- Frontend: Svelte Single Page Application
- Web: Nginx with Reverseproxy configuration. I took it from [here](https://medium.com/@frontendfoo/docker-react-express-reverse-proxy-15d7b37f8dc2) probably.
- With a Docker setup to get it up and running

## Disclaimer

I just created this littel app for fun and to get familiar with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) Javascript Framework, [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), [Tailwind](tailwindcss.com) and [Docker](https://docker.com).

This is not a production ready application whatsoever.
I will not provide any support or bug fixes.

## Missing

- Proper error handling and input validation.
- Automatic ISBN resolver maybe.
